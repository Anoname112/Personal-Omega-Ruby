# Personal Omega Ruby
Omega Ruby personalized to my liking.

Features:
- <a href="https://anoname112.github.io/Personal-Omega-Ruby/">Wild encounters</a> modified to make many Pokemon from gen 1 to 6 available, but Hoenn natives are still the majority.
- Starter ultimate moves are modified because they are the 'ultimate' moves, not the inferior moves. 100 Accuracy, no recharge, and added effect.
- Base stats of mega Kanto starters are modified.
Mega Venusaur: -10 Attack, +10 Speed
Mega Charizard X: -10 SpAttack, +10 Speed
Mega Charizard Y: -10 Attack, +10 Speed
Mega Blastoise: -10 Attack, +10 Speed
